# SuperRobotics Home assignment:

<strong>Please answer in English</strong>

## questions:
1. Describe your experience with programming arduino like boards, microcontroller etc. describe a project you’ve made/was part of.
2. What excites you about robotic programming rather than computer programming?
3. Do you have experience in Computer Vision? What environment/tools/libraries/language? describe
4. Do you use/work with CAM/CAD software? Which? For what? Can you add something you designed?
5. Do you have any background in electronics? Technical skills?
6. Describe in a detail your experience with ROS, Gazebo, rvis other tools. An in depth description of a robot you have developed or a project you made is best.

7. For each case answer the following questions: 
Assuming I want to create a system that does the following:
* I want to detect a person entering the house door, and turn on the AC:

    for a non-smart AC
    
    for smart AC

* I want to create a home display for today’s weather and current home temperature
* I want measure the distance I have traveled by bicycle (4 options)
* I want to measure the angle between two objects

    What HW should I use in each case?(controller, sensors etc.) And how would I use it? Be detailed and specific about the HW as possible, types, name or even model. Services, algorithms or libraries you know. 
No need to implement anything. 




## Python Assignment:

Decode the provided encoded.txt file.
 
<strong>Read all instructions before starting!</strong>

### Rules for decoding:
A relevant character is surrounded by 6 other chars, the format [c1][c2][c3][X][c4][c5][c6], where X is the relevant char, and ‘c#’ describe the decoding of X.
Rules of c#:
* C1 is always a capital letter
* C2 is always a number
* If X is capital C3 will be 0, else lower case.
* C5 always a letter
* C6 has twice the ascii value of C4
* The minimum distance between two relevant X is 87 chars.

Once finished, follow the instructions from the decoded message.

Feel free to show off your pythonic way of writing code while maintaining a short and readable code.
Submit your code and decoding result in a txt file.
If your code requires a special python libs include a requirements.txt listing them with version.

<strong>Use python 3!</strong>
